        I'm a full-stack Rails-based engineer.<br/>
        I prefer delivering complete bottom-to-top slices of work, from the database design to the views. I like to be a part of desiging the big picture as well as working through implementation details. I like having time to consider how each layer should function to make one unified whole.

        <strong>I love ...</strong><br/>
        &#8594; working with product, design, and engineering leadership.<br/>
        &#8594; mentoring junior engineers and learning from my peers.<br/>
        &#8594; team environments which revolve around humor, positivity, & interpersonal support.

        My favorite things center on leading projects from inception to completion, and digging into legacy code cleanup. Given license to dream, I begin to imagine what a cleaner codebase might look like, and become motivated to make that vision a reality.
