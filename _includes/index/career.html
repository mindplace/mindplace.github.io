        I'm a full-stack Rails-based engineer.<br/>
        I prefer delivering complete bottom-to-top slices of work, from the database design to the views. I like to be a part of desiging the big picture as well as working through implementation details. I like having time to consider how each layer should function to make one unified whole.

        My favorite things center on leading projects from inception to completion, and digging into legacy code cleanup. Given license to dream, I begin to imagine what a cleaner codebase might look like, and become motivated to make that vision a reality.
